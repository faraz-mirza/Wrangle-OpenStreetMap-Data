    "After this review of the data, I can tell that the San Francisco Bay Area is incomplete. The categorization of data, auditing and cleaning has been done on basis of a sample of Original Data(3.00 GB) which might not be enough to correctly remove all kinds of problems. With a rough GPS data processor in place like pygeiocoder along with other libraries, I think it would be possible to input a great amount of cleaned data to OpenStreetMap.org. \n",
    "\n",
    "It interests me to notice a fair amount of GPS data makes it into OpenStreetMap.org on account of users’ efforts. There are a high number of users with more than 100 contributions. However, there's a significant number of users that have contributions lower than 10. OSM can improve these contributions if they provide a fast learning map editor with an interactive tutorial, inline help and a much more intuitive UI helping users to map hundreds of distinct features like roads, trails, buildings, parks, cafés, schools and hospitals.\n",
